# Products layout

- [DEMOLINK](https://tykhan.github.io/products/)

Technologies:
- ReactJS
- Redux
- Redux-Thunk

Some libs used:
- ReactTooltip - for hidden tip in card if description to long
- ReactImageFallback - for default image in card, if incorrect link or image wasn't added

Additional info:
  Starting products were taken from fake store API - https://fakestoreapi.com/.
  But there is no possibility for editing, deleting and so on. For those aims were used simple JS synchronous array methods.
